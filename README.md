# Det3D

A general 3D Object Detection codebase in PyTorch

## Introduction

Det3D is the first 3D Object Detection toolbox which provides off the box implementations of many 3D object detection algorithms such as PointPillars, SECOND, PIXOR, etc, as well as state-of-the-art methods on major benchmarks like KITTI(ViP) and nuScenes(CBGS). Key features of Det3D include the following aspects:

* Multi Datasets Support: KITTI, nuScenes, Lyft
* Point-based and Voxel-based model zoo
* State-of-the-art performance
* DDP & SyncBN

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Quick Start

Please refer to [GETTING_START.md](GETTING_START.md).

## Model Zoo and Baselines

We provide many baseline results and trained models. Please refer to [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md).
